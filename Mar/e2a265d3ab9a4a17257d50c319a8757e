The U.S. State Department Wednesday honored women and girls who have led protests in Iran as it gave out its International Women of Courage awards. In addition to 11 individuals honored at the White House ceremony, this year the State Department announced a new group award named after former Secretary of State Madeline Albright. “In every region, there are other women doing this work who we can’t name individually – in some cases because the attention would put them at even greater risk. So we’ve found a new way to honor them,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
