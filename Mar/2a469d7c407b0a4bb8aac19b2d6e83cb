Iran Wednesday ordered two German diplomats to leave the country in response to a similar move by Germany last week. The German expulsion of two Iranian diplomats came in protest of Iran’s sentencing German national Jamshid Sharmahd to death. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Wednesday that Germany was interfering in Iran’s “internal and judicial affairs.” Iran accused Sharmahd of leading the armed wing of a pro-monarchist group, which his family denied. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said after the sentencing last week that Sharmahd was arrested under “highly questionable circumstances” and that he “never had even the semblance of a fair trial.” Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
