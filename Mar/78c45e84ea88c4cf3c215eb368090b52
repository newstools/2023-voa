Another train operated by the Norfolk Southern railroad company derailed in Ohio on Saturday, prompting local officials to order residents living near the site of the accident to shelter in place. Norfolk Southern said the train that derailed near Springfield, Ohio, was not carrying any hazardous materials and that no one was hurt. The accident occurred a month after a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, about 290 kilometers northeast of Springfield. The East Palestine derailment sent toxic chemicals into the environment and forced thousands of people to evacuate. Norfolk Southern said in an emailed statement that Saturday's derailment of about 20 cars of a 212-car train happened as it was traveling southbound near Springfield. The statement did not give any cause for the derailment. "No hazardous materials are involved and there have been no reported injuries," Norfolk Southern said in the statement. "Our teams are en route to the site to begin cleanup operations." Clark County officials on Saturday asked residents living within 305 meters of the latest derailment to "shelter-in-place out of an abundance of caution," according to a statement on the county's Facebook page. That statement added that there were power outages in the area because of downed power lines resulting from the accident.
