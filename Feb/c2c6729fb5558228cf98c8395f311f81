A series of shootings late Monday at Michigan State University left at least three students dead and five other people injured. Chris Rozman, interim deputy chief of the campus police department, told reporters early Tuesday the injured were all hospitalized in critical condition. Rozman said the suspected shooter was a 43-year-old male who was later found dead outside of the campus with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and that he had been “confronted by law enforcement.” Rozman said the suspect was not affiliated in any way with the university. “We have no idea why he came to campus to do this tonight. That is part of our ongoing investigation,” he said. The shootings began at an academic building and continued a short time later with more shots fired at the nearby student union, prompting authorities to order those on campus to shelter in place. “Our campus grieves,” Teresa Woodruff, the university’s interim president, told reporters. “We will all grieve, and we will change over time. We cannot allow this to continue to happen again.” The university canceled all campus activities for 48 hours. Michigan State has about 50,000 students at its campus in East Lansing, located 145 kilometers northwest of Detroit. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
