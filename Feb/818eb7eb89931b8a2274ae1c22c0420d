A 16-year-old girl has been killed in a shark attack in Western Australia. Authorities in Perth believe she jumped off a jet ski in the Swan River to swim with a pod of dolphins. Officials say they do not know what kind of shark was involved in the attack. The teenager had critical injuries when she was pulled from the water and died at the scene. Police Acting Inspector Paul Robinson said counseling services are being offered to anyone who witnessed or is affected by the attack.
