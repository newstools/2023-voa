All times EST. 7:55 a.m.: Dozens of crates are stacked in rows at what is said to be a hangar at Tolmachevo Airport in Novosibirsk, in Russia‚Äôs Siberia region, a video that has gone viral in recent days shows, according to RFE/RL. Zooming in, the footage indicates what appears to be death certificates tacked on to each wooden box, apparently serving as coffins. Each document contains a surname and initials. One of those documents has the name ‚ÄúGerbold. Buryatia‚Äù is inscribed. Relatives of Gennady Gerbold, 39, from Buryatia, in the Siberia region, confirmed to RFE/RL‚Äôs Siberia.Realities earlier this week that officials from Wagner had informed them two weeks earlier of his death while fighting with the mercenary group in Ukraine and later that his body had been returned to Novosibirsk.  Officials at Tolmachevo Airport, however, deny that the video was filmed there. 7:10 a.m.: Russia's offensive in the east is increasingly targeting Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military said on February 28, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warning the situation is becoming "extremely difficult" for the defenders of the city, whom he called "heroes," RFE/RL reports. Ukrainian forces repelled more than 60 attacks by Russian troops in the eastern region of Donetsk over the past 24 hours, Ukraine's General Staff said in its morning briefing on February 28. Russian attacks continue to focus on the Lymansk, Avdiyivka, and Shakhtarsk directions, but the main vector of the Russian assault remains Bakhmut, it added. 6:15 a.m.: Russia's defense ministry on Tuesday accused Ukraine of launching attempted drone strikes against civil infrastructure targets in two southern Russian regions overnight, but said the attacks had failed. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities, Reuters reported. "Overnight, the Kyiv authorities attempted to use unmanned aerial vehicles to attack civilian infrastructure facilities in the Krasnodar and Adygea regions," the defense ministry said in a statement. It said its anti-drone defense systems had repelled the attacks, causing the drones to veer off course and fail to inflict any damage. "Both drones lost control and deviated from their flight paths. One fell into a field, the other, deviating from its trajectory, did not harm the intended target," it said. Russian state news agencies had earlier reported a fire at an oil depot in the Krasnodar region, around 240 km (149 miles) south-east of the Crimean peninsula, after a drone was spotted flying overhead. 5:40 a.m.: NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance in the "long-term" but stressed that the immediate issue is it remaining an independent nation in the face of Russia's invasion, Agence France-Presse reported. "NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a member of our alliance, but at the same time that is a long-term perspective," Stoltenberg told reporters during a visit to Finland's capital Helsinki. 5:10 a.m.: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will arrive in Beijing on Tuesday, kicking off a three-day trip in which he will meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The state visit by Lukashenko ‚Äî a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äî comes after Beijing released a position paper on Russia's war in Ukraine insisting it is a neutral party and calling for dialogue between the two sides. It also follows allegations by the United States and NATO that Beijing could be mulling sending arms to Russia as the conflict enters its second year. China has strenuously denied the claims. Ahead of Lukashenko's visit, Beijing hailed its "all-weather and comprehensive" strategic partnership with Minsk. In an interview with China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Belarusian leader said he was looking forward to meeting with his "old friend" Xi. Agence France-Presse had the full report. 4:30 a.m.: A hacking attack caused some Russian regional broadcasters to put out a false warning on Tuesday urging people to take shelter from an incoming missile attack, Reuters cited the emergencies ministry as saying. "As a result of the hacking of servers of radio stations and TV channels, in some regions of the country information about the announcement of an air alert was broadcast," the ministry said in a statement. "This information is false and does not correspond to reality." Among the regions where the fake messages were broadcast was Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. On regional TV an image was shown with a symbol of a man running for cover from incoming missiles and a message reading "Everybody to the shelter, now," according to images posted on social media. Radio stations played a loud siren sound with a message stating: "Attention, attention. An air alert is being issued. Everybody head to shelters now. Attention, attention. Missile threat." Russian state media cited some local officials blaming Ukraine for the messages. There was no official comment from Kyiv. Gazprom Media, which operates a number of regional TV stations, said its infrastructure had been "attacked" in a statement cited by RIA Novosti. "Such attacks on our satellite network are becoming part of our everyday work," the company said. Several radio stations put out similar warnings last week, and websites run by Russia's state TV conglomerate went down during President Vladimir Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address to Russian lawmakers on February 21 in what state media said was a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 3:55 a.m.: Germany's Rheinmetall has won an order in the double-digit million-euro range to supply Ukraine with automated reconnaissance systems, the industrial group said in a statement on Tuesday according to Reuters. Rheinmetall is cooperating with the Estonian company DefSecIntel to provide the SurveilSPIRE systems, which consist of mobile surveillance towers with day and night-capable camera equipment, autopiloted mini drones and a control system. Delivery has already commenced, the company added. 3:20 a.m.: ‚ö°Ô∏èGeneral Staff: Ukraine repels 60 Russian attacks over past 24 hours. The Ukrainian military repelled 60 Russian attacks in five areas over the past 24 hours in northeastern and eastern Ukraine, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported in its morning update. 2:25 a.m.: The commander of Ukrainian ground forces Colonel general Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Tuesday that the situation around the besieged town of Bakhmut is "extremely tense," according to Reuters. "Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defenses of our troops and surround the city," Syrskyi was quoted as saying on the Ukraine's Media Military Center Telegram messaging platform. 2:05 a.m.: Finland, which has one of Europe's longest borders with Russia, on Tuesday kicks off a parliamentary debate aimed at accelerating the country's bid to join NATO, increasing the likelihood it will leave neighbor and military partner Sweden behind. Spooked by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Finland and Sweden dropped their decades-long policies of military non-alignment and applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May last year. But facing fewer diplomatic hurdles than Stockholm, Helsinki appears set to move forward even before Finland's April general elections, as public opinion also supports membership in the transatlantic military alliance. The two countries have the support of all but two of NATO's 30 members, the holdouts being Hungary and particularly Turkey. Many Finnish MPs have pushed for legislation affirming that Finland accepts the terms of the NATO treaty to be passed before the elections on April 2. Finland will debate the bill on Tuesday, coinciding with a visit from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg ‚Äî who will meet with Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinisto. A vote is expected by Wednesday, and having the bill passed means that Finland can act swiftly even if the ratifications come in before a new government has been formed. Agence France-Presse had the full report. 1:25 a.m.: Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 28 February 2023Find out more about Defence Intelligence: https://t.co/v3cDaShXOAüá∫üá¶ #StandWithUkraine üá∫üá¶ pic.twitter.com/Sa5TUFHvxF 1 a.m.: Reuters reported that the Kremlin gave a lukewarm response to a Chinese plan to end the war in Ukraine, calling for a study of nuances of the proposal that urges both sides to agree to a gradual de-escalation and warns against the use of nuclear weapons. China, which declared a "no limits" alliance with Russia shortly before Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine a year ago, called for a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine on Friday, touting its own peace plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Tuesday that Beijing's voice should be heard, but the nuances of the proposal are important. "Any attempt to formulate theses for reaching a peaceful settlement of the problem is welcome, but, of course, the nuances are important," Peskov told the Izvestia daily. Earlier, Peskov said any such initiatives that might bring peace closer were worthy of attention. "We are paying a great deal of attention to the plan of our Chinese friends," Peskov told reporters on Monday. "Of course, the details need to be painstakingly analyzed taking into account the interests of all the different sides. This is a very long and intense process." He said Russia was continuing to prosecute what it calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine, and for now didn't see any signs suggesting a peaceful resolution could be achieved. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia's actions, most recently at a weekend meeting of the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies. 12:31 a.m.: #Russian officials are promoting an information operation that falsely frames Russia‚Äôs war in #Ukraine as existential to the continued existence of the Russian Federation.https://t.co/zvB9p2fR97 pic.twitter.com/tsEH84QgcP 12:01 a.m.: Russia will not resume participation in the START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States until Washington listens to Moscow's position, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Tuesday, Reuters reported. President Vladimir Putin last week delivered a warning to the West over the war in Ukraine and announced Russia's decision to suspend participation in the latest START treaty, after accusing the West of being directly involved in attempts to strike its strategic air bases. Peskov told the daily Izvestia in an interview that the "attitude of the collective West," led by the United States needs to change towards Moscow. "The security of one country cannot be ensured at the expense of the security of another," Peskov said. He also said that NATO by arming Ukraine "acts as a single bloc no longer as our conditional opponents, but as enemies." Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
