U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the annual Munich security conference this month, her office said Monday. Harris will use her February 16-18 stay in Germany and her attendance at the annual forum, as the war in Ukraine nears one year of combat, "to demonstrate Transatlantic unity and resolve," said a communique from press secretary Kirsten Allen. The 59th edition of the security conference, which draws leaders from around the world, will be held February 17-19. Harris will give a speech at the conference itself and meet with foreign leaders. Her presence will also show U.S. leadership in the world and "our enduring commitment to support Ukraine," the statement said.
