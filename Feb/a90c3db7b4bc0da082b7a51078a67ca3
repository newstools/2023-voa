Pakistan officials say at least 14 members of a wedding party, including children, died when the bus that was taking them back to Lahore from Islamabad fell into a ravine and overturned. Dawn, a Pakistani newspaper, reported that 64 people were injured in the accident Sunday night that happened on a dangerous stretch of a highway near Kallar Kahar. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has expressed his sympathies to the families and has ordered authorities to provide the injured with the best medical care.
