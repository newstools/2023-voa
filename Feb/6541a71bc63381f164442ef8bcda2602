Every spring in Washington, the Japanese cherry trees bloom bright pink and white; however, the U.S. National Park Service has announced that one of the indicator trees, which usually blooms two weeks before the others, is already budding even though it’s still winter.

Gifted by the mayor in Tokyo in 1912 as a demonstration of the strong relations with the United States, the cherry blossoms are a popular attraction. Most of the trees are around the Tidal Basin near the Jefferson Memorial. The National Cherry Blossom Festival runs from March to April each year and includes food, music and entertainment events. The NPS uses a combination of temperature analysis, historical records and indicator trees to estimate when the trees will bloom, but it’s a difficult process. Environmentalists and park officials are worried about climate change affecting the cherry blossom seasons. “What we have seen over the last 100 years or so is both the average date getting earlier by about six days, while at the same time we have seen temperatures on the Tidal Basin increase a statistically significant 2.4 degrees,” National Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst told the WUSA9 television station. Peak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms are open. The average date of peak bloom is April 4, but in 2022, it was a full 10 days ahead of schedule. This year, the indicator tree started to show buds another 10 days earlier than 2022.
