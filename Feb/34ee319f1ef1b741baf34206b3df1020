Peru's attorney general's office said Tuesday on Twitter that the U.S. State Department had agreed to extradite former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo on corruption charges. Peru has been trying to extradite Toledo, the Andean country's president between 2001 and 2006, since 2018. Peruvian authorities allege that Toledo negotiated bribes of up to $20 million with Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht. Toledo has denied soliciting or receiving bribes.
