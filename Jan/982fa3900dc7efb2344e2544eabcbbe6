Hong Kong said Thursday it will soon no longer require people infected with COVID-19 to quarantine. Chief Executive John Lee told lawmakers the move is “one of the most important steps towards normalcy.” The new policy will begin January 30, and follows a similar move by mainland China earlier this month. People in Hong Kong will still be required to wear masks unless exercising. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
