Ukraine and the European Union will hold a summit in Kyiv on February 3 to discuss financial and military support, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said in a statement on Monday. Zelenskyy discussed details of the high-level meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in his first phone call of the year, the statement said. "The parties discussed expected results of the next Ukraine-EU summit to be held on February 3 in Kyiv and agreed to intensify preparatory work," the statement read. The leaders talked about the supply of "appropriate" weapons and a new $19 billion financial assistance program to Ukraine, with Zelenskyy pushing for the first tranche to be sent this month, it said. Last month, the EU cleared the way to giving Ukraine the aid in a so-called "megadeal" that included the adoption of a minimum 15% global corporate tax rate.
