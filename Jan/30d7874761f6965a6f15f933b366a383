U.S.-based aircraft manufacturer Boeing pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that it misled regulators about two crashes of its 737 Max planes. Boeing was accused of hiding design flaws that caused the plane crashes in 2018 and 2019. The judge will decide whether to appoint a special monitor to examine safety issues at Boeing. Family members of the passengers who died in the crashes have asked that a previous settlement between Boeing and the Justice Department be thrown out. They say they were not informed about the secret negotiations between Boeing and the federal agency that allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution. After its agreement with the Justice Department, Boeing established a multibillion-dollar fund to pay for fines, victim compensation and compensation to airlines whose Max jets were grounded after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed hundreds of people. Some information in this report was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.
