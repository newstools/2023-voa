All times EST.  3 a.m.: According to Reuters, Russia's buffeted IT sector risks losing more workers in the new year because of planned legislation on remote working, as authorities try to lure back some of the tens of thousands who have gone abroad without prompting them to cut ties completely. Having relatively portable jobs, IT workers featured prominently among the many Russians who fled after Moscow sent its army into Ukraine on February 24 and the hundreds of thousands who followed when a military call-up began in September. The government estimates that 100,000 IT specialists currently work for Russian companies overseas. Now, legislation is being mooted for early next year that could ban remote working for some professions. Hawkish lawmakers, fearful that more Russian IT professionals could end up working in NATO countries and inadvertently sharing sensitive security information, have proposed banning some IT specialists from leaving Russia. But the Digital Ministry said in December that a total ban could make Russian IT firms less effective, and so less competitive: "In the end, whoever can attract the most talented staff, including those from abroad, will win." 2:29 a.m. : The fugitives reportedly include three Uzbek nationals, a Kyrgyz national, a Belarusian, and one Russian national who were said to have fled a Vagner training camp in the eastern Ukrainian Luhansk region.https://t.co/VdYwl9MTCm 2 a.m.: Detailed footage of brutal battles ‚Äî from Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine or from a game?

The district, located on the left bank of the Dnipro River, is chiefly a residential area and the capital's most populous district. Ukraine's regional military command in the country's east said air defense systems destroyed nine Iranian-made Shahed drones over the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions by early hours of Monday.
