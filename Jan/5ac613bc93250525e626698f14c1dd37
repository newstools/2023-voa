Chris Hipkins is set to replace Jacinda Ardern as leader of the Labour party and New Zealand's prime minister after being the only candidate to be nominated for the role, the Labour Party said in a statement Saturday. Hipkins is expected to be confirmed as the new leader by a meeting of Labourâ€™s 64 lawmakers, or Caucus, on Sunday. First elected to parliament for the Labour Party in 2008, Hipkins, 44, became a household name fronting the government's response to the pandemic after being appointed minister for COVID-19 in November 2020. Hipkins is currently minister for the Police, Education, Public Service and serves as leader of the House.
