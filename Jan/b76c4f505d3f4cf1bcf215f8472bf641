Police in Hungary said Friday one police officer was killed and two others injured when they were stabbed while responding to a disturbance at a Budapest apartment complex. A Budapest police department statement said the officers responded to a call late Thursday at the building in the cityâ€™s Ujbuda district and discovered a man trying to break down a door into an apartment. Police said the suspect attacked the officers with a knife as they tried to detain him and ran into the street where a fourth officer fired at him, striking him in the leg. The wounded officers and the suspect were all transported to a hospital. One of the officers, a 29-year-old police sergeant major, died from his injuries. Budapest chief prosecutor Pal Furcht told a news briefing Friday the attack is not being investigated as a terrorist incident. Speaking on state radio Friday, Hungary's Prime Minister Victor Orban said the government would provide assistance to the family of the slain officer.
