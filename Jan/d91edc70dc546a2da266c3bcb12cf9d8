An American citizen who had been detained in Russia for nearly a year was released Thursday. 

Taylor Dudley, who is 35, was detained when he crossed from Poland into Kaliningrad, near Moscow, last year in April. 

CNN reports the Michigan resident’s detention was not widely reported because his family wanted the negotiations for his release to remain private.

He was attending a music festival in Poland, but it is not clear why he crossed the border into Russia. 

It appears that no exchange was made for Dudley on the U.S. side. 

Negotiations for Dudley’s release were headed up by former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.
