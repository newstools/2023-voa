Authorities in France say an attacker armed with a knife wounded six people Wednesday morning at a busy train station in Paris. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters police shot the attacker, who was “between life and death” after being taken to a hospital. The attack happened at the Gare du Nord station, one of the busiest in Europe. The motive for the attack was unclear, and authorities say they have opened a criminal investigation. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
