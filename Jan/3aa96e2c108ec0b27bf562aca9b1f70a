Nearly four months after the start of anti-government protests in Iran, a U.S.-based human rights monitor says 516 protesters have been killed. Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, said Monday the dead included 70 children. The latest figures from the group also put the number of people arrested at more than 19,200, among them 687 students. The protests began in mid-September in response to the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained by Iran’s morality police for violating the country’s dress code.
