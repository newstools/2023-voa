New York City is known for many things and now is breaking some weather records. Dubbed the city that never sleeps or the big apple, New York has broken a 50-year record — set on January 29, 1973 — for its latest-ever measurable winter snowfall. Snow is highly unlikely Monday with temperatures expected to reach 10.5 degrees Celsius with mostly sunny conditions expected. A few days later, the city could also break another record — 332 days without measurable snow, a record set on December 15, 2020. The fallout from climate change? Probably. But the snow may come yet. February is a notoriously unpredictable weather month and like the American musician Prince’s well known song goes... sometimes it snows in April.
