Iran summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires in Tehran on Monday over his country's comments on a drone strike on a military factory in the central Iranian province of Isfahan, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. In Ukraine, which accuses Iran of supplying hundreds of drones to Russia to attack civilian targets in Ukrainian cities far from the front, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy linked the incident directly to the war there. "Explosive night in Iran," Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. "Did warn you." War logic is inexorable & murderous. It bills the authors & accomplices strictly.Panic in RF - endless mobilization, missile defense in Moscow, trenches 1000 km away, bomb shelters preparation.Explosive night in Iran - drone & missile production, oil refineries.ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ did warn you A U.S. official told Reuters that Israel appears to have been behind the attack. Iran has acknowledged sending drones to Russia but says they were sent before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. Moscow denies its forces use Iranian drones in Ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there.
