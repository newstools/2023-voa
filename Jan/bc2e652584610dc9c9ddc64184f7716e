Mexico's Supreme Court elected the first female chief justice in its history Monday. Justice Norma Lucia Pina was sworn in for her four-year term at the head of the 11-member panel, pledging to maintain the independence of the country's highest court. "Judicial independence is indispensable in resolving conflicts between the branches of government," Pina said Monday while laying out her plans. "My main proposal is to work to build majorities, leaving aside my personal vision." As chief justice, Pina will also head the entire judicial branch. She is not considered an ally of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and opposition parties welcomed her election. The 6-5 vote by her fellow ministers Monday came despite Lopez Obrador's pressure on them. Lopez Obrador had backed another female justice, Yasmin Esquivel, for the top post. But indications emerged recently that Justice Esquivel might have plagiarized an academic paper to get her bachelor's degree in the late 1980s. The public university where she got that degree is still studying the case; her thesis, presented in 1987, was identical to one presented a year earlier. Esquivel claimed the earlier thesis copied her later work. The president has pushed a number of controversial laws through Congress only to see them blocked by the courts, and getting an ally elected as chief justice was seen as key for Lopez Obrador. On Monday, he claimed "the judicial branch has been kidnapped ... has been eclipsed by money, by economic power." However, Senator Olga Cordero, Lopez Obrador's former Interior Secretary, welcomed Pina's election. "Now is the time of human rights, the time for women," Cordero wrote in her social media accounts.
